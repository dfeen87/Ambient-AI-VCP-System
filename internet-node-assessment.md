Yes—using the current codebase and technology stack, you can make internet-through-node access happen without a rewrite: your API already has the control-plane primitives (`open_internet` node type, `connect_only` task routing, strict policy-shaped inputs, eligibility checks, assignment lifecycle), so the practical path is to add a data-plane service on selected nodes that enforces those policies at runtime. Concretely, keep `api-server` as policy authority + session issuer, keep current assignment logic for selecting eligible `open_internet` nodes, and add a node gateway process that establishes mTLS/WireGuard/QUIC sessions, enforces `egress_profile` and `destination_policy_id`, applies `duration_seconds` and `bandwidth_limit_mbps` quotas, emits metering/audit events back to the API, and tears down sessions on timeout or heartbeat loss; this leverages your existing Rust services, node capability model, and task orchestration semantics, while only introducing the missing relay/tunnel execution plane.

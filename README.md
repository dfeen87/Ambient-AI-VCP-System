## 🧩 What Is This?

The Ambient AI + VCP System is an open-source platform for **distributed, verifiable AI computing**. It connects devices that have spare compute capacity — laptops, servers, edge boxes — into a self-organizing mesh where work can be submitted, scheduled, and cryptographically verified. A built-in control plane handles node registration, health scoring, task routing, and result validation, so you don't have to build any of that yourself.

What makes the system distinctive is its combination of a **Verifiable Computation Protocol (VCP)** with a practical mesh runtime. Every task can be backed by a Zero-Knowledge proof (Groth16/BN254) that proves the computation happened correctly without revealing private inputs, and every node carries its own trust score derived from real telemetry. Beyond pure compute, the AILEE trust layer adds multi-model consensus, an energy-weighted efficiency metric (∆v), and offline-first operation — nodes can authenticate sessions, cache egress policies, and sync with peers over a direct P2P channel even when the central API is unreachable. The result is an end-to-end platform for building trustworthy, resilient AI workflows across heterogeneous hardware.

## 🧾 In Plain English: What this app does

Think of this app as a **service for compute power**:

- Some people have spare machines (laptops, servers, edge devices) and register them as **nodes**, metadata per node is private but all avaialable publicly.
- Other people submit **tasks** they want computed, they are private to the user.
- The system finds appropriate nodes, runs the work, and tracks results.
- It can also verify that work was executed correctly using cryptographic proofs.

In plain terms: this application is a control center for distributed AI computing. Through a single dashboard, you can send tasks to multiple machines, run them in parallel, and watch the entire cluster update in real time.

What’s especially powerful is that the system is model-agnostic — it doesn’t care whether a task runs on a GPU node, a CPU worker, a proof generator, or even multiple AI models working together. If a workflow requires several components or agents, the platform can orchestrate them across the cluster automatically.

It’s designed to make complex compute workflows feel effortless — from launching jobs to monitoring performance and managing results — all through one unified interface.

**New to the system?** Here's what you need to know:

**The System is a Two-Sided Service:**
- **Node Operators** (Supply) = People who provide computing power (you register your device)
- **Task Submitters** (Demand) = People who need computing power (developers, researchers, businesses)
- **The System** = Matches tasks to nodes, orchestrates execution, returns results

**Nodes** = Devices that join the network to contribute computing power (your laptop, server, etc.)
  - **5 Node Types**: Compute (run tasks), Gateway (route traffic), Storage (store data), Validator (verify proofs), Resonator (FEEN physics)
  - 👉 [Learn more about node types →](./docs/NODES_AND_TASKS_GUIDE.md#node-types-explained)

**Tasks** = Work submitted to the network for execution (train a model, run a computation, etc.)
  - **6 Task Types**: Federated Learning, ZK Proof, WASM Execution, General Computation, Connect-Only, FEEN Connectivity
  - **Who creates tasks?** App developers, data scientists, researchers, businesses - anyone who needs computation
  - 👉 [Learn more about task types →](./docs/NODES_AND_TASKS_GUIDE.md#task-types-explained)

### Post-v2.3.0 Improvements
- 🛣️ **Internet Path Routing**: `PeerRouter` resolves direct or one-hop relay paths through `Universal`/`Open` nodes; `MeshCoordinator` exposes `sync_connectivity()` and `find_peer_route()` for runtime reachability updates
- 🔌 **Gateway Session Lifecycle**: `DataPlaneGateway::add_session()` / `revoke_session()` — sessions provisioned and revoked at runtime so nodes stop relaying traffic the instant a connect session ends
- ⚡ **Non-Blocking Password Hashing**: `hash_password_async()` offloads bcrypt to a blocking thread pool; configurable cost via `BCRYPT_COST` env var (default 12, range 4–31)
- 🔔 **Heartbeat-Triggered Task Sync**: `update_node_heartbeat` now calls `assign_pending_tasks_for_node` on every ping, so live nodes receive eligible pending tasks continuously — not only at registration
- 🎨 **Offline-First Dashboard Fonts**: Syne and JetBrains Mono fonts are self-hosted from bundled woff2 files; no Google Fonts CDN dependency, dashboard renders fully in air-gapped environments
- 🛡️ **Safe-Default Backhaul Routing**: `monitor_only = true` is the new default — the backhaul manager observes interfaces and scores them without touching kernel routing tables until explicitly opted in; `ip rule` entries are scoped to `from <src-ip>` to avoid affecting unrelated host traffic; health probes bind to the interface's own address for accurate per-interface metrics
- 🌐 **NCSI Spoof Server**: `NcsiSpoofServer` prevents false `ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED` errors when the node acts as internet gateway for connected clients. When a client's direct internet is gone and the VCP node is the upstream provider, the client OS connectivity checks (Windows NCSI `GET /connecttest.txt`, Linux NetworkManager `GET /check_network_status.txt`, and generic captive-portal probes) are answered locally by a lightweight HTTP listener configured with `NcsiSpoofConfig`, stopping the OS from blocking traffic with a false disconnection signal.
- 🌍 **HTTP CONNECT Proxy**: `HttpConnectProxy` lets a browser on an offline node route all HTTPS traffic through a connected relay node, permanently bypassing `ERR_INTERNET_DISCONNECTED`. Point the browser's proxy settings at `<relay-ip>:3128`; it issues `CONNECT host:443 HTTP/1.1` with a `Proxy-Authorization: Bearer <token>` header, the proxy validates the token and opens a bidirectional TCP tunnel to the real destination. Non-CONNECT requests are rejected (405), bad or missing tokens return 407, and upstream failures surface as 502/504. Configured via `HttpConnectProxyConfig` (listen address, bearer token, connect/idle timeouts, enabled flag).
- 📶 **Relay Session QoS**: `RelayQosManager` installs WAN-side `tc` HTB + FQ-CoDel rules on the active backhaul interface when a `connect_only` session is active on an `open_internet` or `any` node — guaranteeing minimum bandwidth and low latency for relayed traffic while preventing node-internal traffic from crowding out the relay stream. Call `BackhaulManager::activate_relay_qos()` when a session starts and `deactivate_relay_qos()` when it ends.
- 💓 **Hardware Keepalive**: `BackhaulManager` now emits periodic hardware-level keepalive probes via `hardware_keepalive_tick(now_secs)`; the interval and enabled flag are controlled by `HardwareKeepaliveConfig` inside `BackhaulConfig` — keeping `connect_only` relay links alive through NAT devices and stateful firewalls that would otherwise expire idle sessions.
- 🏓 **Node Heartbeat Tracking** (`NodeRegistry`): `record_heartbeat(id, now_secs)` stores the last-seen timestamp for each registered node; `is_node_alive(id, now_secs, timeout_secs)` returns `true` while the node is within its liveness window — enabling the mesh coordinator to detect stale nodes without a round-trip to the API server.
- 🌐 **`internet_required()` on `LocalSessionManager`**: reports whether any active local session requires outbound internet connectivity, allowing `BackhaulManager` to prioritise interface selection for relay tasks.

### Node-to-Task Connectivity (v2.4.0)
- 🏥 **Heartbeat Modal Response**: `PUT /nodes/{id}/heartbeat` now returns `health_score`, `node_status`, `active_tasks`, `assigned_task_ids`, and a rich `assigned_tasks` array — each entry carries `task_id`, `task_type`, and `execution_status` so node processes can react immediately (e.g. activate gateway mode for `connect_only` tasks).
- 📋 **Execution Status Lifecycle**: `task_assignments` now tracks `execution_status` (`assigned` → `in_progress` → `completed`/`failed`), `execution_started_at`, and `execution_completed_at` across all paths: node result submission, synthetic fallback, connect_only session end, and forced disconnection (delete / reject / offline sweep).
- 🔄 **Activity Registration**: The first heartbeat a node sends after being assigned to a task advances `execution_status` from `assigned` → `in_progress`, recording the exact moment the node confirmed it is actively working.
- 📤 **Task Result Submission** (`POST /api/v1/tasks/{id}/result`): Nodes can now submit real execution outputs to the API instead of relying solely on synthetic fallback. When `require_proof = true`, a ZK proof must accompany the result and is verified before the task is marked completed.
- ⏱️ **Honest Fallback Timeout**: For non-`connect_only` tasks the synthetic fallback now waits the full `max_execution_time_sec` before firing — giving nodes time to submit real results. Previously it fired immediately, preempting any real output.
- 🛡️ **Completed Task Protection**: `update_task_status_from_assignments` now carries an `AND status NOT IN ('completed','failed')` guard, preventing a node going offline from silently reverting an already-completed task to `pending`.
- 🌐 **Gateway Session Polling** (`GET /api/v1/nodes/{id}/gateway-sessions`): `open_internet` / relay nodes can poll this endpoint each heartbeat cycle to receive the current set of active `connect_only` sessions they should relay, including the cleartext `session_token` the `DataPlaneGateway` needs to validate incoming relay connections. The session token is stored server-side on session creation and returned only to the authenticated node owner.
- 💤 **Node Offline Sweep**: A background task runs every `NODE_OFFLINE_SWEEP_INTERVAL_SECONDS` (default 60 s). Any node whose `last_heartbeat` is older than `NODE_HEARTBEAT_TIMEOUT_MINUTES` (default 5 min) is marked `offline`, its active assignments are disconnected (in-progress ones marked `failed`), and affected tasks are immediately reassigned to other eligible nodes.
- 🏆 **Health-Score Node Selection**: Task assignment now orders candidates by `health_score DESC` (then `registered_at ASC` as tiebreaker) so healthiest nodes are always preferred; the redundant `registered_at` and `health_score` columns were also removed from the `GROUP BY` clause since they are functionally dependent on the `node_id` primary key.

### Security & Infrastructure
- 🔐 **JWT Middleware Authentication**: Global JWT enforcement at middleware layer (not handler extractors)
- 🛡️ **Rate Limiting**: Per-endpoint tier-based rate limiting (Auth: 10rpm, Nodes: 20rpm, Tasks: 30rpm, Proofs: 15rpm)
- 🔄 **Refresh Tokens**: JWT token rotation with 30-day refresh tokens and automatic revocation
- 🔒 **CORS Hardening**: Configurable origin-based CORS (no wildcards in production)
- 📊 **Prometheus Metrics**: `/metrics` endpoint with per-route latency and error tracking
- 📝 **Audit Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for security events
- 🔍 **ZK Proof Verification**: Cryptographic verification (Groth16/BN254) with strict payload validation
- 🔑 **P2P Message Integrity**: Ed25519 signature verification for offline peer policy sync messages; signer public key validated against the local trusted key set
- 🛡️ **Middleware Hardening**: Explicit state injection for reliable authentication flow
- 🌐 **Security Headers**: HSTS, X-Content-Type-Options, X-Frame-Options, Referrer-Policy
- 📊 **Request Tracing**: Structured logging with request IDs for all API calls
- 💾 **Enhanced Persistence**: Migrations for task_runs, proof_artifacts, api_keys, audit_log, node_heartbeat_history

### Security Policy: Node Registry + Task Intake
- **Capability whitelist (registration)**:
  - `bandwidth_mbps`: `10..=100_000`
  - `cpu_cores`: `1..=256`
  - `memory_gb`: `1..=2_048`
- **Task-type registry (submission)**:
  - Canonical task types: `federated_learning`, `zk_proof`, `wasm_execution`, `computation`
  - Per-type policies: max execution time, max payload size, and WASM allow/deny
- **Node registry enforcement (admission control)**:
  - Task creation checks for enough eligible online nodes that meet the task policy before insert.

### 7. **CLI Tool** (`cli`)
**Purpose**: Command-line interface for system management

```bash
# Start a compute node
ambient-vcp node --id node-001 --region us-west --node-type compute

# Start connect_only data-plane gateway on an open_internet node
ambient-vcp gateway --listen 0.0.0.0:7000 --sessions-file ./gateway-sessions.json

# Start a coordinator
ambient-vcp coordinator --cluster-id cluster-001 --strategy weighted

# Check node health
ambient-vcp health
```

Gateway sessions file format (`gateway-sessions.json`):

```json
[
  {
    "session_id": "sess_123",
    "session_token": "cs_your_ephemeral_token",
    "egress_profile": "allowlist_domains",
    "destination_policy_id": "policy_web_basic_v1",
    "allowed_destinations": ["*.example.com", "1.1.1.1"],
    "expires_at_epoch_seconds": 1735689600
  }
]
```

### 8. **Local Node Observability** (`ambient-node/observability`) 🆕
**Purpose**: Privacy-preserving, operator-only node inspection

**🔒 Privacy & Security Design:**
- ✅ **Local-only access**: Binds strictly to `127.0.0.1` (no external network access)
- ✅ **Operator-only**: Only the node owner can access this interface
- ✅ **Read-only**: No mutation or control of execution state
- ✅ **Privacy-preserving**: Does NOT expose private payloads, secrets, or sensitive data
- ✅ **No telemetry**: Does NOT send data to centralized systems or enable cross-node visibility
- ✅ **Optional**: Disabled by default, must be explicitly enabled

**Usage:**

```bash
# Start a node with local observability enabled
ambient-vcp node --id node-001 --region us-west --node-type compute \
  --observability --observability-port 9090

# The node will print a curl command on startup:
# curl http://127.0.0.1:9090/node/status | jq

# Inspect your node (example output):
curl http://127.0.0.1:9090/node/status | jq
```

**Example Response:**

```json
{
  "node_region": "us-west",
  "node_type": "compute",
  "uptime_seconds": 3600,
  "current_workload": "generation",
  "resources": {
    "cpu_percent": 45.2,
    "memory_percent": 62.8,
    "temperature_c": 68.0
  },
  "trust_summary": {
    "trust_threshold": 0.7,
    "last_trust_score": 0.85,
    "lineage_hash": "abc123...",
    "models_used": 2
  },
  "health_score": 0.78,
  "safe_mode": false,
  "timestamp": 1771453109
}
```

**Architecture:**
- Strict separation: observability MAY read execution state, but execution MUST NEVER depend on observability
- No blocking operations that could affect node performance
- Exposes only high-level, non-sensitive metrics (uptime, resource usage, trust scores)
- Trust decision metadata (scores, thresholds, hashes) - no payloads or model inputs

### 9. **AILEE ∆v Metric** (`ailee-trust-layer/metric`) 🆕
**Purpose**: Time-integrated efficiency monitoring based on the [AILEE paper](https://github.com/dfeen87/AILEE-Trust-Layer)

The AILEE framework introduces an *energy-weighted optimization gain functional* ∆v that accumulates performance gain over time while penalising inertia and off-resonant operation:

```
∆v = Isp · η · e^(−α·v₀²) · ∫ P_input(t) · e^(−α·w(t)²) · e^(2α·v₀·v(t)) / M(t) dt
```

- 📐 **`AileeMetric`**: Accumulates successive telemetry samples via `integrate()` and exposes `delta_v()` at any point in time
- 📋 **`AileeSample`**: Per-interval telemetry snapshot — compute/power input `P_input`, workload `w`, adaptation velocity `v`, and model inertia `M`
- 🎛️ **`AileeParams`**: Configurable resonance sensitivity `α`, efficiency coefficient `η`, specific factor `Isp`, and reference state `v₀`
- 🔒 Overflow-safe: both exponential resonance gates are clamped to prevent `f64` overflow for large telemetry values

**Usage:**
```rust
use ailee_trust_layer::metric::{AileeMetric, AileeSample};

let mut metric = AileeMetric::default();
metric.integrate(&AileeSample::new(100.0, 0.5, 1.2, 10.0, 1.0)); // P, w, v, M, dt
let gain = metric.delta_v(); // dimensionless efficiency gain
```

### 10. **Peer-to-Peer Policy Sync** (`ambient-node/offline`) 🆕
**Purpose**: Keep nodes operational and internet-capable even when disconnected from the API endpoint

> **Answer to "Can we connect nodes and power internet while disconnected from the API?"**  
> **Yes.** The `LocalSessionManager` runs in `OfflineControlPlane` mode when the WAN is up but the API is unreachable. Nodes can now *share verified policy snapshots directly with each other* — no central server needed.

- 🔗 **`PeerPolicySyncMessage`**: A serialisable, SHA3-256-integrity-protected snapshot of a node's egress policies and verification keys — covers full policy content (IDs *and* destinations) so tampering with allowed destinations also invalidates the hash
- 📤 **`LocalSessionManager::export_peer_sync()`**: Snapshot the current policy cache for distribution to peers
- 📥 **`LocalSessionManager::import_peer_sync()`**: Non-destructively merge policies from a peer — existing local entries are *never* overwritten, preventing a compromised peer from downgrading local policies
- 📋 Every import is appended to the local audit queue with event type `peer_sync_applied`
- ✅ Works in `OfflineControlPlane`, `NoUpstream`, and `OnlineControlPlane` states

**Node states:**

| State | API reachable | WAN up | Internet egress | Peer sync |
|-------|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| `OnlineControlPlane` | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ | ✅ |
| `OfflineControlPlane` | ❌ | ✅ | ✅ (cached policies) | ✅ |
| `NoUpstream` | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ (receive only) |

**Usage:**
```rust
// Node A (has fresh policies) → exports a snapshot
let msg = node_a_mgr.export_peer_sync("node-A");

// Node B (API offline, stale cache) → imports non-destructively
let added = node_b_mgr.import_peer_sync(&msg)?;
// node-B can now activate sessions and route traffic using the synced policies
```

### 11. **Web Dashboard** (`api-server/assets`)

### 12. **FEEN Physics Engine Integration** (`ambient-node/feen`) 🆕
**Purpose**: Local wave-native physics simulation powering the `feen_resonator` node type and `feen_connectivity` task type

> **FEEN repository**: [https://github.com/dfeen87/FEEN](https://github.com/dfeen87/FEEN)

FEEN is a Duffing-resonator physics engine — VCP acts as the orchestrator while FEEN remains a self-contained, local physics backend.  The integration exposes three minimal REST endpoints (`/api/v1/simulate`, `/api/v1/coupling`, `/api/v1/delta_v`) and keeps FEEN internals fully hidden behind a clean Rust trait boundary.

**New VCP primitives introduced:**

| Primitive | Kind | Description |
|-----------|------|-------------|
| `feen_resonator` | Node type | Wraps a FEEN resonator's physical state `(x, v)`, coupling config, and accumulated ∆v |
| `feen_connectivity` | Task type | Uses FEEN to compute resonance, interference, stability, and ∆v across a set of nodes |

**Core Rust types** (`crates/ambient-node/src/feen.rs`):

- 🔧 **`ResonatorConfig`** — resonator parameters: `frequency_hz`, `q_factor` (damping), `beta` (nonlinearity)
- 📍 **`ResonatorState`** — physical state snapshot: displacement `x`, velocity `v`, `energy`, `phase`
- 🔗 **`CouplingConfig`** — directed coupling between two resonators: `source_id`, `target_id`, `strength`, `phase_shift`
- ⚡ **`Excitation`** — drive signal: `amplitude`, `frequency_hz`, `phase`
- 🧩 **`FeenEngine` trait** — async interface (`simulate_resonator`, `update_coupling`) that allows both the live HTTP client and test mocks to be used interchangeably
- 🌐 **`FeenClient`** — HTTP client that posts to the FEEN REST API (`/api/v1/simulate`, `/api/v1/coupling`)
- 🏗️ **`FeenNode`** — stateful VCP node that wraps a `FeenClient`, owns the current `ResonatorState`, and accumulates the AILEE ∆v metric across ticks

**FEEN-side REST API** (`feen-changes/`):

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `/api/v1/simulate` | POST | Stateless single-step simulation of a resonator |
| `/api/v1/coupling` | POST | Apply a coupling update between two resonators |
| `/api/v1/delta_v` | POST | Compute the AILEE ∆v metric for a sequence of telemetry samples |

**Usage:**
```rust
use ambient_node::feen::{FeenClient, FeenNode, ResonatorConfig, Excitation};

// Connect to a locally-running FEEN instance
let client = FeenClient::new("http://localhost:8080".to_string());
let config = ResonatorConfig { frequency_hz: 440.0, q_factor: 10.0, beta: 0.0 };
let mut node = FeenNode::new(client, config);

// Drive the resonator one time step (dt = 1 ms)
let excitation = Excitation { amplitude: 1.0, frequency_hz: 440.0, phase: 0.0 };
node.tick(&excitation, 0.001).await?;

// Read the accumulated efficiency gain
println!("∆v = {}", node.delta_v());
```

**Architectural invariants:**
- 🔒 Each `/api/v1/simulate` call is **stateless** — state is owned by VCP, never by FEEN
- 🔒 No persistent identity, session, or user semantics are introduced in FEEN
- 🔒 `FeenNode` uses the **`FeenEngine` trait**, keeping the HTTP transport swappable for tests
- 🔒 ∆v is computed **locally** by VCP's `AileeMetric`, not delegated to FEEN

## 🔒 Security & Validation

### Authentication & Authorization ⭐ **NEW**

**Node Ownership & Lifecycle:**
- ✅ **JWT Authentication**: All node operations require valid JWT tokens
- ✅ **User Registration**: Secure account creation with bcrypt password hashing
- ✅ **Node Ownership**: Nodes linked to user accounts via foreign key constraint
- ✅ **Authorization**: Users can only manage their own nodes
- ✅ **Soft Delete**: Nodes can be deregistered with audit trail (deleted_at timestamp)
- ✅ **Heartbeat Tracking**: Detect stale/offline nodes via last_heartbeat timestamp
- ℹ️ **Read Visibility Emphasis**: `GET /nodes` and `GET /tasks` are authenticated endpoints and currently return shared authenticated views; ownership checks apply to node management actions

**Security Best Practices:**
- ✅ Parameterized SQL queries prevent injection attacks
- ✅ Error messages sanitized to prevent information leakage
- ✅ 404 responses for both missing and unauthorized resources
- ✅ Foreign key constraints ensure referential integrity
- ✅ Production mode enforces strong JWT secrets (min 32 characters)

## 🧪 Executable Specification (Living Contract)

The test files included in this repository are not just unit tests — they serve as a **living, runnable specification** of the Ambient AI VCP System.

Each test encodes the exact return contract for:

- **AILEE Trust Layer** (`GenerationResult`)
- **AmbientNode health, safety, and reputation**
- **MeshCoordinator routing, selection, and reward flow**
- **FederatedAggregator FedAvg rounds and versioning**

These tests ensure that:

- the system’s behavior is deterministic  
- return structures remain stable across versions  
- contributors can understand the architecture by *running* it  
- regressions are caught immediately  
- the repo doubles as documentation and verification  

If you are extending or modifying the system, update the tests to reflect the new contract.  
If you are integrating the system, use these tests as the authoritative reference for expected behavior.

- ✅ **Security Documentation** - Comprehensive guides and best practices
- ✅ **Data Persistence** - PostgreSQL with migrations

### ⭐ Phase 2.7 - Offline-First Node Connectivity & AILEE Metric (COMPLETED) 🆕
- ✅ **AILEE ∆v Metric** — energy-weighted optimization gain functional from the AILEE paper; accumulates telemetry samples and produces a dimensionless efficiency score for comparative diagnostics
- ✅ **Overflow-safe resonance gates** — exponential terms in ∆v are clamped to `[-700, 700]` before evaluation to prevent `f64` overflow under extreme telemetry values
- ✅ **Peer-to-Peer Policy Sync** — nodes share cryptographically-verified policy snapshots directly without the control plane, keeping the mesh operational and internet-capable in `OfflineControlPlane` and `NoUpstream` states
- ✅ **Full-content integrity hashing** — `PeerPolicySyncMessage` hashes policy IDs *and* allowed destinations *and* full verification-key bytes, ensuring that modifications to any component (policy IDs, destinations, or keys) invalidate the hash
- ✅ **Persistent chained audit log** — every `import_peer_sync` call appends a `peer_sync_applied` record to a SHA3 hash-chained audit queue, providing a tamper-evident history of all policy imports
- ✅ **Ed25519 session lease signing** — `SessionLease` payloads are signed with Ed25519 and verified fully offline, enabling a node to authenticate new sessions without ever contacting the control plane
- ✅ **Three-state node model** — `LocalSessionManager` tracks `OnlineControlPlane`, `OfflineControlPlane`, and `NoUpstream` states, enforcing appropriate policy restrictions at each tier
- ✅ **Mesh connectivity analysis & peer routing** — `PeerRouter` classifies each node's reachability and resolves forwarding paths; Universal nodes are preferred over Open nodes to minimise relay depth
- ✅ **Real-time session revocation** — `DataPlaneGateway::revoke_session()` removes a session from the live store instantly, stopping traffic relay the moment a connect session ends
- ✅ **70 new tests** across `ailee-trust-layer` and `ambient-node` crates

### ⭐ Phase 2.8 - Routing, Auth Hardening & Operational Reliability (COMPLETED) 🆕
- ✅ **Internet Path Routing** — `PeerRouter` added to `mesh-coordinator`; classifies node reachability and resolves direct or relay forwarding paths through `Universal`/`Open` nodes
- ✅ **Gateway Session Lifecycle** — `DataPlaneGateway` gains `add_session()` and `revoke_session()` for runtime session management; relaying stops the moment a session is revoked
- ✅ **Non-Blocking Password Hashing** — `hash_password_async()` offloads bcrypt to `spawn_blocking`; cost configurable via `BCRYPT_COST` env var (default 12)
- ✅ **Pepper Config Polish** — all pepper env vars pre-configured in `docker-compose.yml` and `.env.example`; missing-pepper warnings downgraded to `debug` in development
- ✅ **Heartbeat-Triggered Task Assignment** — `update_node_heartbeat` now calls `assign_pending_tasks_for_node`, closing the gap where live nodes only received tasks at registration time
- ✅ **Self-Hosted Dashboard Fonts** — Syne and JetBrains Mono bundled as woff2 assets; no CDN dependency, dashboard works fully offline and in air-gapped deployments
- ✅ **Safe-Default Backhaul Routing** — `monitor_only = true` default prevents unintended kernel routing changes; `ip rule` entries scoped to source IP; health probes bound to the interface under test for accurate per-interface metrics

### ⭐ Phase 2.9 - Relay QoS for connect_only Tasks (COMPLETED)
- ✅ **WAN-side Relay QoS** — `RelayQosManager` installs Linux `tc` HTB + FQ-CoDel rules on the active WAN backhaul interface when a `connect_only` session starts on an `open_internet` or `any` node; relay traffic receives a guaranteed minimum bandwidth and a burst ceiling while node-internal traffic is protected by a separate reserved floor — eliminating congestion between relay streams and node control traffic
- ✅ **DSCP/TOS Classification** — egress packets already marked with DSCP EF (value 46) are steered into the high-priority relay HTB class via a `u32` filter; the HTB default class is also set to the relay class so unmarked relay TCP connections benefit without requiring end-to-end DSCP support
- ✅ **Bufferbloat Reduction** — an FQ-CoDel qdisc is attached to the relay class by default, providing active queue management and per-flow fairness that keeps relay session latency low even under sustained throughput
- ✅ **`BackhaulManager` integration** — new `activate_relay_qos()` and `deactivate_relay_qos()` methods apply or remove the WAN QoS rules against the currently active interface; `RelayQosConfig` is part of `BackhaulConfig` with safe production defaults (10 Mbps guaranteed, 1 Gbps ceiling, 1 Mbps node floor)
- ✅ **10 new tests** across `relay_qos` unit tests and `BackhaulManager` integration tests

### ⭐ Phase 2.10 - Hardware Keepalive & Node Heartbeat Tracking (COMPLETED) 🆕
- ✅ **Hardware Keepalive** — `BackhaulManager::hardware_keepalive_tick(now_secs)` emits periodic low-level keepalive probes at a configurable interval (`HardwareKeepaliveConfig`), preventing NAT and stateful-firewall session expiry on idle `connect_only` relay links
- ✅ **Node Heartbeat Tracking** — `NodeRegistry::record_heartbeat(id, now_secs)` and `is_node_alive(id, now_secs, timeout_secs)` give the mesh coordinator a lightweight, no-network-round-trip liveness signal for each registered node
- ✅ **`internet_required()` on `LocalSessionManager`** — returns `true` when any active local session needs outbound internet, enabling `BackhaulManager` to prioritise WAN interface selection for relay tasks

### ⭐ Phase 2.11 - FEEN Physics Engine Integration (COMPLETED) 🆕
- ✅ **`feen_resonator` node type** — new VCP node wrapping a FEEN Duffing resonator; owns physical state `(x, v)`, coupling configuration, and an `AileeMetric` accumulator that tracks ∆v across ticks
- ✅ **`feen_connectivity` task type** — new VCP task that uses FEEN to compute resonance, interference, stability, and ∆v across a group of resonator nodes
- ✅ **`FeenClient` Rust HTTP client** — posts to the local FEEN REST API (`/api/v1/simulate`, `/api/v1/coupling`) using `reqwest`; error handling propagates FEEN API status codes as typed `Result` errors
- ✅ **`FeenEngine` trait boundary** — clean async trait separates VCP logic from the FEEN transport, keeping the HTTP client swappable with in-process mocks for unit tests
- ✅ **Stateless simulation contract** — resonator state lives entirely in VCP; each `/api/v1/simulate` call is a pure function `(config, state, input, dt) → state′` with no server-side persistence
- ✅ **FEEN-side minimal REST surface** — three endpoints added under `feen-changes/`: `/simulate`, `/coupling`, `/delta_v`; no FEEN internals exposed beyond what VCP needs
- ✅ **12 new unit tests** covering construction, physics mock, error propagation, coupling updates, and JSON serialisation round-trips for all FEEN VCP types
- 🔗 **FEEN repository**: [https://github.com/dfeen87/FEEN](https://github.com/dfeen87/FEEN)
